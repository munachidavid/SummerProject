					<h1>THE FIRST DAY I VISITED SHOPRITE</h1>
					<hr>
					<P>Growing in Africa is so much fun, especially if you have parents who love you, my mom told me stories of how they fetched water from the stream, fetched firewood from the forests, and watched masquerades at the village square.<br><br>
                Amazingly, as thrilled as I am about such stories, they are not the type of fun a 21st century child will have. So I always dream of flying in an airplane, going to a game house, visiting the cinema, riding a carousel, going to a shopping mall etc.<br><br> 
                  One day, my mom and dad decided to take us on a trip to celebrate my youngest brother Duke’s birthday. On the D day, we woke up quite early, did our chores, quickly had our bath and dressed to leave. My parents were ready too so we boarded our vehicle and left the house.<br><br>
                     On our way, my mom asked me to guess where we were going,  I thought a little and said “the airport”, she said incorrect, our village, she said no. where are we going then, I asked? Please tell me. I give up. “The Shoprite” she exclaimed. Immediately, I and my two brothers started jubilating because our long awaited dream is coming true.<br><br> 
   My father drove from Nnewi to Asaba, to make this dream a reality. We passed through Onitsha, where we met series of traffic jam. The fascinating thing about Onitsha for me is the river Niger. We passed over the river Niger Bridge and I saw canoes paddling in the river. We then moved on straight to Asaba and before long, we were face to face with biggest shopping mall in the city of Asaba: SHOPRITE!<br><br>
    We almost couldn’t believe our eyes; we were over excited because finally we’re here to have our own experience. My cousins Chike and Ngozi told us several stories about Shoprite Lagos. This spurred our curiosity and left us constantly thinking about what our own experience will be like.<br><br>
    Immediately my dad parked the car, we jumped down to feed our eyes with the excitement going on the environment. The first thing noticed was how the name of the mall was written boldly in bright red color and the edges blinking and showing off white light. And it reads this: Asaba Shopping Mall Shoprite. Secondly, I noticed that there were many people at the mall in search of one thing or the other. Topping the list is fun. I saw many people chatting with friends and family, snapping pictures, relaxing etc. Thirdly I have always thought that the whole mall was occupied by Shoprite, but on coming into the mall, I discovered that there are other shops and offices co-habiting the mall with Shoprite. This cares for variety of customers. My father took us to an eatery where we made choices of the food we wanted. And I ate jellof rice with chicken. We had delicious meals. After we went into the Shoprite and wow! I have never seen such a big shopping place before. It looks like you can get everything you want in there. We bought items like back scratcher, video game, fun and learning toy laptop, frying pan, chocolates, biscuits, bread, ice cream etc.<br><br> 
   On our way out, we went to the cinema stand. My dad bought tickets for all of us to go see a movie. He also bought popcorn and we got complimentary drinks to enjoy at the cinema. We saw a movie titled “The Ant Man”. It was really fun. My mother would have preferred a movie that is more children friendly because my brother Duke who we came to celebrate his third birthday was really scared of the heavy sounds at the cinema. I and Daniel wasn’t, we enjoyed the movie till the end.  By the time the movie was over, it was time to go. We really wished that this fun day wouldn’t end. We thanked our parents for helping have a fun filled day. And that’s how I had a super doper first time visit at Shoprite.
